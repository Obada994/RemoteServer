# RemoteServer
Private remote server designed to serve different clients, and will be the first step into a smart home project.
A breif description: 
Every Client has his own folder on the server and we have different kinda clients with different previliges, and one root client that can controll the server totally, the communication between the server and the client is encrypted using AES 128 bit encryption and you can set the maxuimum number of clients you want your server to take, later on I'm adding arduino boards to do some different functions.
Server: is whereever you compile the server.jar (Could be your laptop,Desktop,raspberry pi....etc)
Client: us whereever you compile the client.jar (Will create it's own repository).
P.S: this is repository is server side only..
